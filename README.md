### Powershell - Scan IP Range Quickly with Multithreading

This script scans an IP range very quickly. I use this as a base when scanning the network.

The script returns IP, DNS, and MAC entries.

Although slower, I've found this script to be more dependable than AD's computer list and Powershell's Get-NetNeighbor scan.
